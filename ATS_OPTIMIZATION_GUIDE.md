# ATS Optimization Guidelines

This document outlines best practices for optimizing resumes for Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and AI scanners.

## Key Statistics
- 97.8% of Fortune 500 companies use ATS
- 99.7% of recruiters use keyword filters to sort applicants
- 75% of companies overall rely on ATS for hiring

## Formatting Requirements

### File Format
- **Preferred:** .docx (Word document)
- **Alternative:** PDF (only if requested)
- Why: ATS reads .docx more accurately than PDFs

### Visual Elements to AVOID
- Headers and footers (put contact info in body)
- Tables, templates, borders
- Charts, graphics, logos, images
- Text boxes or columns
- Shading or background colors
- Fancy fonts or font colors (use black only)
- Symbols (except standard bullet points)

### Recommended Fonts
- Arial
- Calibri
- Times New Roman
- Helvetica

### Section Headers
Use simple, standard headers:
- Experience (or Professional Experience)
- Skills
- Education
- Certifications
- Professional Summary (or Summary)
- Key Achievements

## Content Strategy

### 1. Keyword Optimization
- **Extract keywords** from job description
- **Use exact phrases** that appear in job posting
- **Incorporate naturally** - modern ATS AI understands context
- **Avoid keyword stuffing** - write for humans first
- **Strategic placement:** Professional Summary, Skills section, Experience bullets

### 2. Professional Summary
- 2-3 sentences at top of resume
- Incorporate 3-5 keywords from job description
- Highlight most relevant experience and skills
- Make it compelling for both ATS and human readers

### 3. Skills Section
**Include BOTH:**
- **Hard skills:** Technical tools, software, methodologies (exact names from job posting)
- **Soft skills:** Leadership, communication, collaboration, problem-solving

**Format:**
- List skills that match job description first
- Use exact terminology from job posting
- Group by category if helpful (e.g., "Technical Skills," "Leadership Skills")

### 4. Experience Section
**Formatting:**
- Reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- Company name and dates clearly visible
- Job title matches industry standards

**Bullet Points:**
- Start with action verbs
- Include quantifiable achievements (%, $, numbers)
- Incorporate job description keywords naturally
- Focus on accomplishments, not just duties
- 2-4 bullets per role

**Example:**
- "Led cross-functional team of 20+ people, resulting in 15% increase in delivery rate"
- "Conducted A/B testing and data analysis using Google Analytics and Looker"

### 5. Achievements
- Quantify everything possible (32% increase, 50% reduction, $2M revenue)
- Use specific metrics
- Match achievements to job requirements
- Place most impressive achievements prominently

## Modern ATS Considerations (2025)

### AI Context Understanding
Newer ATS tools use AI that understands:
- Context and synonyms
- Natural language
- Semantic meaning (not just exact keyword matches)

**Implication:** Write naturally for humans while incorporating relevant keywords

### Remote Work Era
Highlight if relevant:
- Remote work experience
- Virtual collaboration tools
- Time management in distributed teams
- Async communication skills

## Submission Best Practices

1. **Follow instructions:** If employer requests .doc, send .doc (not PDF)
2. **One resume per job:** Tailor each resume to specific job
3. **Plain text check:** View your resume in plain text to ensure it's readable
4. **Contact info location:** Put in body of document, not header/footer
5. **Standard file naming:** "FirstName_LastName_Resume.docx"

## Testing Your Resume

Before submitting:
1. Save as .txt file and review - does it still make sense?
2. Check that all sections appear in logical order
3. Verify contact information is visible (not in header)
4. Confirm keywords from job description are present
5. Read aloud - does it sound natural or stuffed with keywords?

## The Balance

**Goal:** Create a resume that:
- Passes ATS keyword filters (gets you in the door)
- Reads naturally for human reviewers (gets you the interview)
- Accurately represents your experience (no hallucinations)
- Highlights relevant achievements (stands out from competition)

**Remember:** You're optimizing for both robots AND humans. Modern ATS is smart enough to understand natural language, so prioritize clarity and authenticity while strategically incorporating relevant keywords.
