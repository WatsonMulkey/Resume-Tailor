Dear Hiring Manager,

I was thrilled to see the Product Manager role at Metabase - it's exactly the kind of mission-driven, user-focused work I'm passionate about. As an experienced product leader with a track record of driving measurable impact, I'm confident I can make an immediate contribution to your team.

What excites me most about this opportunity is Metabase's commitment to bringing data tools with the elegance and simplicity of consumer products to the enterprise world. Throughout my career, I've consistently focused on understanding user needs at a deep level and then crafting thoughtful, data-driven strategies to address them. At Discovery Education, for example, I overhauled the teacher-side app based on user research, resulting in a 32% year-over-year increase in user engagement. I'd love to apply that same user-centric approach to help Metabase continue expanding access to powerful data analytics.

In addition to my user empathy, I also bring strong technical knowledge that allows me to truly understand the underlying mechanics of the products I manage. At Simplifya, I refactored the flagship auditing product, reducing completion time by 50% and driving a 40% usage increase. This ability to bridge the gap between user needs and technical constraints is crucial for delivering the kind of seamless, intuitive experience that aligns with Metabase's vision.

Throughout my career, I've also demonstrated the project management and cross-functional leadership skills that are essential for this role. At Discovery Education, I led teams of 20+ people, resulting in a 15% increase in delivery rate. I'd be excited to bring that same collaborative, results-oriented approach to Metabase as you continue scaling your product and team.

I'm deeply inspired by Metabase's mission to democratize data insights, and I believe my background makes me uniquely qualified to contribute to your success. I'd welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experience can help Metabase deliver even more value to your users. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.

Sincerely,
Watson Mulkey
