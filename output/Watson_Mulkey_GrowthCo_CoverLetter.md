Dear Hiring Manager,

I'm excited to apply for the Senior Product Manager - Growth role at GrowthCo. As a mission-driven product leader, I'm drawn to GrowthCo's goal of empowering knowledge workers through intuitive, delightful software. Throughout my career, I've been most fulfilled by roles that create meaningful impact, from driving a 32% increase in user engagement for an edtech platform serving 50 million students, to boosting efficiency and usage by 50% for a cannabis compliance software.

Here's why I'm a great fit for this position:

• Proven track record of driving user growth and engagement: At Discovery Education, I overhauled the teacher-side app based on user research, resulting in a 32% year-over-year increase in engagement. I also identified and recovered 10% of traffic loss within the first month.

• Expertise in data analysis and A/B testing: I've partnered closely with data teams to develop reporting pipelines and present monthly insights to the C-suite. At Simplifya, I used A/B testing and experimentation to drive a 50% reduction in completion time and 40% usage increase for the flagship product.

• Cross-functional leadership experience: I've managed teams of 4-7 at Discovery Education, as well as 20+ people across 5 teams, delivering a 15% increase in content delivery rates. I excel at aligning diverse stakeholders around a shared product vision.

• Ability to work with less technical users: Whether training product managers or supporting constrained users, I'm adept at translating complex concepts into accessible language. At The Iron Yard, I created an issue tracking system that reduced open ticket time by 40%.

I'd love an opportunity to discuss how my background in driving user growth, passion for data-informed decision-making, and cross-functional leadership skills make me the ideal candidate for this role. Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to speaking soon.

Best regards,
Watson Mulkey
