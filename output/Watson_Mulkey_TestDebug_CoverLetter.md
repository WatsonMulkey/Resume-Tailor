Dear TestDebug Hiring Team,

I'm excited to apply for the Product Manager position at TestDebug. Having spent my career helping teams build better products through user research and data-driven decisions, I'm drawn to how TestDebug empowers developers to create more reliable software. Your focus on debugging and testing tools resonates deeply with my experience working across technical teams where quality and user experience are paramount.

Here's why I'm a great fit for this role:

**Product management with technical depth:** At Registria, I currently manage platform products for major brands like Sony and Whirlpool, building reporting suites that help technical and non-technical stakeholders make sense of complex data. This mirrors TestDebug's need for someone who can bridge the gap between developer needs and business outcomes. My experience spans everything from 0-1 product launches at Simplifya to scaling platforms serving 50M users at Discovery Education.

**User research driving product decisions:** You mentioned user research as a key requirement, and this has been central to my biggest wins. At Discovery Education, I conducted extensive research with teachers to overhaul our teacher-side app, resulting in a __32% year-over-year increase in user engagement__. Similarly, at Simplifya, user interviews revealed pain points in our compliance workflow that led me to refactor the entire auditing product; we saw a __50% reduction in completion time and 40% increase in usage__. I've worked with diverse user segments globally—from teachers in rural districts to cannabis compliance officers to international booksellers—always starting with deep user understanding.

**Data analysis turning insights into action:** At Discovery, I partnered closely with our data team using tools like Looker, Fullstory, and Google Analytics to identify a critical issue where we were losing __33% of our traffic__; I recovered __10% in the first month__ through targeted product improvements. I regularly presented findings to C-Suite leadership and built reporting pipelines that became essential decision-making tools across the organization.

What excites me most about TestDebug is the opportunity to help developers build better software more efficiently. My experience leading cross-functional teams of 20+ people, combined with my track record of using research and data to drive measurable product improvements, positions me well to help TestDebug's users debug faster and ship with confidence.

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how my background in user-centered product development can contribute to TestDebug's mission. Looking forward to speaking soon!

Best regards,
Watson Mulkey
