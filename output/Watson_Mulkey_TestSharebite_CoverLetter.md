I'm excited to apply for the Product Manager position at TestSharebite. Having spent my career building products that solve real operational challenges—from compliance software to educational platforms—I'm drawn to your focus on streamlining workplace food programs through thoughtful product design.

Here's why I'm a great fit for this role:

**Product Management & Cross-Functional Leadership:** At Discovery Education, I led cross-functional teams of 20+ people across 5 departments, delivering a 15% improvement in delivery rates while managing complex multi-vertical dependencies. This experience taught me how to align diverse stakeholders around shared outcomes—essential when coordinating between sales, engineering, and operations teams at a growing company like TestSharebite.

**User Research & Customer-Centric Development:** Your emphasis on user research resonates deeply with my approach. At Discovery Education, I worked directly with teachers to overhaul our teacher-side application based on their feedback, resulting in a 32% year-over-year increase in user engagement across a 50M+ user platform. I've conducted user interviews across diverse segments—from international booksellers at Bookshop.org to cannabis operators at Simplifya—and know how to translate user insights into actionable product improvements.

**Data Analysis & Metrics-Driven Decisions:** I've consistently used data to drive product strategy, partnering with data teams to build reporting pipelines and delivering monthly presentations to C-suite executives. At Discovery Education, I identified a 33% traffic loss through analytics and recovered 10% of that traffic within the first month. My experience with tools like Looker, Fullstory, and Google Analytics would translate directly to measuring and optimizing TestSharebite's key product metrics.

What excites me most about this opportunity is the chance to work on a product that directly impacts workplace culture and employee satisfaction. My most rewarding experiences have been building products that create meaningful value—whether helping teachers engage students more effectively or supporting small businesses through better compliance tools.

I'd love the opportunity to discuss how my experience driving user engagement, leading cross-functional teams, and building data-driven products can contribute to TestSharebite's continued growth. Looking forward to speaking soon!

Best regards,
